# Vue-Monster-Slayer-Game
A turn-based game I made in Vue.JS while learning the library. Nothing too complicated.This was made while I was just begining to learn Vue.
So, the library was loaded using a CDN as opposed to having it included locally. Nothing really much else to say. 

# Installation
Umm.. You just clone it or download it, and open index.html in your browser. That's it.
